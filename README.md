# Source 2 SDK
 A simple Source 2 SDK based of off scraps of code here and there.


NOTE: Some files are too big to upload! Decompress the compressed.7z.001 archive and it should place the required files into the folder

ANOTHER NOTE: This is extremely barebones! There isnt any demo code or stuff like that so you will have to make stuff yourself if you are using
this for development!

(Make sure you keep any modified files under 100 MB!)
